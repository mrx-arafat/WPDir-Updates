## Testing Results

### Build Tests
- ✅ **Go Build**: Successful
  ```bash
  go build -v .
  # Result: Binary created successfully
  ```

- ✅ **Frontend Build**: Successful
  ```bash
  cd web && npm run build
  # Result: Production bundle created
  # Size: 222.34 kB (gzipped)
  ```

### Runtime Tests
- ✅ **Application Startup**: Successful
  - Server starts on configured port (11001)
  - HTTP API responds correctly
  - Logging system working

- ✅ **Plugin Filtering**: Working
  - Successfully fetches plugin list (108,818 plugins found)
  - Filters by last_updated date
  - Handles 404 errors for removed plugins gracefully
  - Processes configured limit

### API Tests
- ✅ **Health Check**: `GET /api/v1/loaded`
  - Response: `{"loaded":false}` (during initial load)
  - Status: 200 OK

## Resource Estimates

Based on configuration with 5,000 plugins and 1,000 themes:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Storage** | ~30GB (vs 200GB+ for full index) |
| **RAM** | 4GB minimum (vs 16GB+ for full) |
| **Initial Index Time** | 2-4 hours (vs 24+ hours for full) |
| **Plugins Indexed** | 5,000 most recent |
| **Themes Indexed** | 1,000 most recent |

## Configuration

### Test Configuration (config.yml)
```yaml
host: http://localhost/
updateworkers: 2
searchworkers: 4
pluginlimit: 5
themelimit: 2
ports:
  http: 11001
  https: 11002
```

### Production Configuration (Recommended)
```yaml
host: http://your-domain.com/
updateworkers: 2
searchworkers: 4
pluginlimit: 5000
themelimit: 1000
ports:
  http: 80
  https: 443
```

## Known Issues & Recommendations

### Initial Load Time
**Issue**: Fetching metadata for 100K+ plugins to sort by last_updated takes significant time.

**Recommendations**:
1. Run initial setup with `-fresh` flag during off-peak hours
2. Consider implementing a caching mechanism for plugin metadata
3. For faster testing, use smaller limits (e.g., 100 plugins)
4. Future optimization: Use WordPress.org browse API with filters

### 404 Errors
**Issue**: Many plugins return 404 (removed from repository).

**Status**: This is expected behavior and handled gracefully. The application logs these and continues processing.

## Next Steps

### For GitHub Repository
1. Create repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/mrx-arafat/wpdir`
2. Push all commits:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### For VPS Deployment
1. Clone the repository on your VPS
2. Follow instructions in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
3. Configure `config.yml` with your settings
4. Build and run using Docker or manual deployment
5. Set up systemd service for production
6. Configure Nginx reverse proxy (optional)
7. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt (recommended)
